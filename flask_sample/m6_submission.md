<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>yes. I had few issues while setup, When I was trying to deploy<br>into heroku, and build the deployment in github, I was getting an error<br>saying pytest command not found. I had to include this dependency in requirements.txt<br>file, and only then it was successful in running my tests and the<br>build also did not fail.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker basically containerizes applications and it can be shipped anywhere, meaning we can<br>deploy , run and scale in any environments. It is like an operating<br>system for containers, similar to like how a virtual machine removes the need<br>to directly manage containers, hardware resources, e.t.c. It provides commands to build ,<br>start or stop containers.&nbsp;<div>The steps needed to run an app inside the docker<br>container are:</div><div>1. Install Docker Desktop: This is the first step and involves downloading<br>and installing Docker Desktop on your system. Docker Desktop is a software tool<br>that allows you to run and manage Docker containers on your computer.&nbsp;</div><div>2. Restart<br>any open terminals/consoles: Once Docker Desktop is installed, you need to restart any<br>open terminals or consoles to ensure that the Docker command-line interface is available.&nbsp;</div><div>3.<br>Use a one-line command to build and run the instance: This step involves<br>using a single command to build and run the Docker container. The command<br>is &quot;docker run -p 3000:8080 --rm -it $(docker build -q ./flask_sample)&quot;. This command<br>will build and run the Docker container and will delete the container once<br>the program is terminated.&nbsp;</div><div>4. Terminate the process: To stop the Docker container, you<br>need to press ctrl + c in the active terminal window.&nbsp;</div><div>5. Open the<br>app in a browser: Once the Docker container is running, you can open<br>your browser and go to localhost:3000 to see the Flask application running locally.<br>If you make any changes to the application, you will need to terminate<br>the Docker container and rerun the command to build and run the container<br>again.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Resources that I followed to understand docker:&nbsp;<a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker">https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker</a></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a cloud-based, platform as a service (PaaS) for building, running, and<br>managing apps. Heroku is used for this class so we can&nbsp; learn and<br>grow our skills by taking advantage of the platform’s fully managed runtime environment<br>included with a wide range of tools and integrated services. Heroku basically makes<br>app deployment fast and easy. We were able to utilize the student credits<br>for app deployment, which was very useful. The platform’s GitHub integration allowed us<br>to connect our Heroku app to our GitHub repo and deploy on every<br>push to GitHub. So by doing this, we can see our app live<br>and anyone from anywhere can view and utilize it as a web app.<div><br><div><div>Resources<br>that I followed to understand Heroku:&nbsp;<a href="https://trifinlabs.com/what-is-heroku/">https://trifinlabs.com/what-is-heroku/</a></div><div><br></div></div></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python that allows us to<br>build web applications quickly and easily. It is designed to be flexible and<br>modular, giving developers the ability to customize their applications to their specific needs.<br>Flask is also known for its simplicity, making it an excellent choice for<br>beginners and small-scale projects.&nbsp;<div>Few things I have learnt about flask is:</div><div>* I have<br>learnt to create a virtual environment inside flask.</div><div>* about CI/CD deployment of a<br>flask app</div><div>* learnt about connecting sql with flask.</div><div>* to decouple our credntials from<br>our code using dotenv</div><div>* learnt about db loader tool initdb</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <ol><br><li>A Dockerfile is used to define a Docker image, while a GitHub<br>Actions YAML file is used to define automated workflows.&nbsp;<div>2. The Dockerfile contains instructions<br>for building a container image, while the GitHub Actions YAML file contains instructions<br>for automating tasks and workflows.&nbsp;</div><div>3. The Dockerfile is used in the process of<br>creating a container image, while the GitHub Actions YAML file is used to<br>execute tasks and workflows within a container environment.&nbsp;</div><div>4. The Dockerfile is specific to<br>Docker, while the GitHub Actions YAML file can be used with other containerization<br>technologies as well.</div><br></li><br></ol><br></td></tr>
